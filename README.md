# Zaparoo Designer

A companion app to the Zaparoo project. The Designer allows you to easily generate Zaparoo labels from templates, ready to print and cut, right from your web browser using external sources for game media. Read more about the Zaparoo project at [Zaparoo.org](https://zaparoo.org/).

Zaparoo Designer is officially hosted at: [design.zaparoo.org](https://design.zaparoo.org/)

# Usage
This app is deployed at [https://design.zaparoo.org](https://design.zaparoo.org/) and you can just use it, providing your own images or using the embedded search functionality.
It has no server, no login, no way to save progress.
Is meant for producing labels and download the result right away.
Everything runs locally, your images aren't unploaded to any server.

1. Navigate to: [design.zaparoo.org](https://design.zaparoo.org/)
2. Select `Add files` to upload a local image or `Search image` to search and load an image from [IGDB](https://www.igdb.com/).
3. Make any template, color or media transformations you like to the final label.
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 for each label you want to create this session.
5. Select `Print` and configure the output that works best for your printer or plotter.
6. Press `Download`.
7. Print the output PDF or PNG files on your printer.
